      <!i><red>Warning! 
      <!i><red>Due to the loading mechanism of MMO plugins,
      <!i><red>the attributes still do not work when only MythicLib is installed.
      <!i><red>You need install MMOItems or MMOCore to let attributes work.

      <dark_gray><i>Using MMO as the attribute system may cause noticeable lag in attack speed.
      <dark_gray><i>Siece 3.8.2 you can add fix-attack-speed to fix this.
